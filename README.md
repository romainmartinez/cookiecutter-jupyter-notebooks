# cookiecutter-jupyter-notebooks

Project structure for doing and sharing data science work.

Allows to automatically generate Jupyter content (repo info, navigation bar, index) from a configuration file (`config.yml`) and Jupyter notebooks (`notebooks/*.ipynb`).

Inspired by [cookiecutter-data-science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) and [PythonDataScienceHandbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook).
